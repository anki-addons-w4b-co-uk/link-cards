When you add <code>cid:1234567890123</code> (card id) or <code>nid:1234567890123</code> (note id) to a card or template this add-ons transforms the text to a clickable hyperlink. When you click it a preview of the card will open in an extra window or the note will be shown in an extra editor window. The latter is experimental, might damage your note and needs to be enabled from the add-on options.

For details about cids/nids see e.g. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#searching" rel="nofollow"></a>.

As always use it at your own risk.

<b># bugs etc.</b>
Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__preview_card_edit_note_in_extra_window_linked_from_reviewer/issues" rel="nofollow">github</a> or via reddit (/u/ijgnord). Maybe I'll have an idea ...
